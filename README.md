# PROJECT ABANDONED
Game abandoned for the assets and code to be repurposed to a better project in the future. 
The emergent concept and game that resulted in this was extremely dull.


# 🧟‍♂️ The Graveyard Shift

*A slapstick stealth-puzzle game about surviving your soul-sucking office job... as a literal zombie.*

## 🎮 Overview

In **The Graveyard Shift**, you play as a freshly reanimated zombie just trying to hold onto his 9-to-5 job without getting fired — or devouring his coworkers. Sneak through the office, complete mundane tasks, avoid bumping into people, and try not to let your undead urges show.

This game was created for a week-long game jam under the theme **"From the Dead."**

## 🧠 Core Gameplay

- **Stealthy Navigation:** Don’t let others see you acting "off." Bumping into people raises suspicion!
- **Task Completion:** Do boring office tasks while hiding the fact that you’re decaying.
- **Survival Pressure:** Manage hunger, suspicion, and bodily decay over the course of 7 dreadful workdays.
- **Slapstick Horror:** Absurd, comedic take on office life — limbs might fall off, coffee might go flying.
